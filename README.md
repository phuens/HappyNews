# HappyNews
Contrary to the regular news website, HappyNews will display only contents that are positive. 
Happynews scraps news from all the news sources provided by <a href="https://newsapi.org/"> NewsAPI.org</a> and then uses <b> TextBlob library </b> 
and <b> IBM Watson </b> to check the polarity of the content. The new content will be displayed if the two libraries detect a high positive polarity.
